            <p>
                While working as a Knitwear Designer, I could never find just the right colors of heathered & donegal wools to use in my designs. So, about twenty years ago, I visited Hunter's of Brora; a Scottish Woollen Mill on the northeast of coast of Scotland. I
                had been working with Hunter's Managing Director, Raymond Eagleson, for many years and he invited me to design & develop exclusive colors. The mill was on the outskirts of the small, charming village of Brora in Sutherland, Scotland.

            <h2>FROM FLEECE TO WOOL TO YARN:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sheep are sheered.</li>
                <li>The fleece is washed to remove as much of the dirt & vegetable matter as possible.</li>
                <li>It is sorted according to quality and color.</li>
                <!-- The sheep are sheered. The raw wool is gathered, cleaned and sorted
   according to quality.-->
                <li>Then the fleece is either carded or combed.</li>
                <li>Carding uses teazels (small teeth or spikes) & produces a rougher wool with shorter fibers & a brushed feel.</li>
                <li>Combing produces wool with longer fibers which when spun, results in stronger yarn that is less prone to pill.</li>
                <li>During combing, shorter fibers & any remaining debris is removed.</li>
                <li>At this stage, the raw wool is known as "tops".</li>
                <li>The tops are either kept in the natural color of the sheep breed, or are dyed in an unlimited range of colors.</li>
                <li>The colors are stored in individual bins.</li>
                <li>Mixing some of the solid-colored tops together creates heathered colors.</li>
                <li>Neps (flecks of colored wool) are added to make custom donegals & tweeds.</li>
                <li>Finally, the yarn is spun to the desired thickness, ply and twist.</li>
